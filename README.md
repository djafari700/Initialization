# Initialization
Welcome to the first assignment of Course 2 of the Deep Learning Specialization!  Training your neural network requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well-chosen initialization method helps the learning process.  In this notebook, you'll try out a few different initializations and see how they lead to different results.

Instructions:

- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.

- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.

Take your time to complete this assignment and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises. When you see

 All tests passed.

...You’re in good shape. :) 

Some code blocks contain graded functions, where you’ll be expected to write some code. These are marked at the top of the block by a #GRADED FUNCTION comment, and you’ll write your code in between the ### START SOLUTION HERE ### and ###END SOLUTION HERE### comments. Also, look for another comment that indicates roughly how many lines of code it will take to complete the graded function. 

After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 70% to pass. Good luck! :)
